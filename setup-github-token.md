# ðŸ”‘ GitHub Personal Access Token Setup

Since the GitHub CLI authentication didn't work, let's use a Personal Access Token instead:

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** â†’ **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Give it a name: `GlChemDraw Release`
4. Select scopes:
   - âœ… `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - âœ… `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **Copy the token** (it starts with `ghp_`)

## Step 2: Set the Token
Run this command in your terminal (replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the actual token):

```bash
gh auth login --with-token < token.txt
```

Or set it as an environment variable:
```bash
$env:GH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Step 3: Create the Release
Once the token is set, I can automatically create the release with all the files!

**Alternative**: You can also create the release manually at:

Would you like me to help you with the token setup, or would you prefer to create the release manually?
