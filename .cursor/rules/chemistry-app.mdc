# Chemical Structure App

## Core Purpose

GL-ChemDraw is a **chemical structure drawing and analysis application**. All features must support chemists working with molecular structures.

## AI Integration Principles

1. **AI supports chemistry workflows** — NMR prediction, IUPAC naming, structure search, reaction suggestions, safety analysis
2. **AI is accessible** — AI features visible in Chemical Info panel; "AI" chip in header scrolls to AI section; "Add context for AI" available in header, NMR dialog, Get AI Name
3. **AI does not interfere** — AI features are additive; existing PubChem, nmrdb, nmr-predictor flows remain primary where applicable
4. **Structure-first** — Drawing canvas, validation, and compound identification are primary; AI augments when data is missing or user requests it

## AI Touchpoints (all must remain accessible)

| Location | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| Header search | Name → structure (PubChem first, AI fallback) |
| Chemical Info header | AI chip (scroll to AI section), Add context icon, Predict NMR |
| AI Assistant (collapsible) | Run analysis, Generate Name, Predict Reactions, Add context |
| NMR dialog | AI prediction, Explain with AI, Add context |
| Get AI Name | When structure unrecognized by PubChem |
| PubChemSearch | AI fallback when no compounds found |
| NameToStructure | AI fallback when PubChem fails |

## Remember

- This is a **chemical structure app** — prioritize structure drawing, validation, and chemistry-specific analysis
- AI enhances; it does not replace core chemistry tools
