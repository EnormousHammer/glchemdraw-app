## 💡 Pro Tips

### Getting Best Integration Results:

1. **Baseline First**
   - Make sure baseline is flat
   - Use processing tools if needed
   - Better baseline = better integration

2. **Peak Detection**
   - Auto peak pick before integrating
   - Verify all peaks are detected
   - Adjust threshold if needed

3. **Region Boundaries**
   - Auto integrate uses smart boundaries
   - For manual: ensure full peak coverage
   - Don't clip peak edges

4. **Normalization**
   - Results shown as relative ratios
   - Set reference peak if needed
   - Check for expected ratios

5. **Verification**
   - Compare integration values
   - Check against expected ratios
   - Look for symmetry in equivalent protons

## 🎯 Common Integration Tasks

### Task 1: Simple Integration
**Goal:** Get ratios for a clean spectrum

```
1. Open file
2. Click AUTO INTEGRATE
3. Read ratios from Integrals panel
4. Export if needed
```

**Time:** < 30 seconds

### Task 2: Complex Spectrum
**Goal:** Integrate overlapping peaks

```
1. Open file
2. Click "Manual" integration button
3. Draw integration regions carefully
4. Adjust boundaries as needed
5. View results
```

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### Task 3: Batch Analysis
**Goal:** Integrate multiple spectra

```
For each spectrum:
1. Load file
2. AUTO INTEGRATE
3. Export results
4. Next file
```

**Time:** ~1 minute per spectrum

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Integration button not working

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for NMRium to fully load
2. Make sure data is loaded first
3. Check console for errors
4. Try manual integration instead

### Problem: No results showing

**Solutions:**
1. Check if Integrals panel is visible
2. Look for integration curves on spectrum
3. Try clicking AUTO INTEGRATE again
4. Verify peaks are detected first

### Problem: Wrong values

**Solutions:**
1. Check baseline correction
2. Verify integration boundaries
3. Ensure full peak coverage
4. Try manual integration for precision

### Problem: Can't see Integrals panel

**Solutions:**
1. Panel should auto-open after integration
2. Look for "Integrals" tab in sidebar
3. In Simple mode, panel is always visible
4. Switch to Advanced mode for full view

## 📊 Understanding Integration Results

### What the Numbers Mean:

**Relative Integration Values:**
```
Peak A: 3.00   ← 3 protons
Peak B: 2.00   ← 2 protons  
Peak C: 1.00   ← 1 proton
```

**Normalized to smallest peak:**
- Ratios show relative proton counts
- Compare against expected structure
- Should match molecular formula

**Absolute Values:**
- Raw integration area
- Not normalized
- Useful for comparison between runs

## 🎓 Why Integration Matters

### Quantitative NMR:
- **Determine structure** from proton ratios
- **Verify purity** of compounds
- **Measure concentrations**
- **Confirm synthesis** success

### Integration tells you:
1. **How many protons** at each chemical shift
2. **Relative amounts** of different groups
3. **Structural confirmation** via ratios
4. **Sample purity** via unexpected peaks

### Without integration:
- ❌ Only qualitative information
- ❌ Can't determine ratios
- ❌ Harder to assign peaks
- ❌ Miss quantitative data

### With our easy integration:
- ✅ One-click quantitative analysis
- ✅ Clear, readable results
- ✅ Fast workflow
- ✅ Professional output
